# 👋 Hi there!

I'm Marcel, a Data School Consultant at The Information Lab in Germany. While I'm now focusing on Tableau and Alteryx at work, I still enjoy tinkering with Python 🐍 for fun projects involving data analysis and AI.

**🔨 Daily tools**
- Tableau (learning)
- Alteryx (ditto)
- Python (a bit rusty, but still my go-to for hobby projects)

**🌱 Learning & Exploring**
- All things Tableau and Alteryx
- Keeping my Python skills alive
- ML and Data Science (someday!)
- R (on the wishlist)
  
**💡 Background in**
- Data Analysis
- Statistics & Research Methods

🤝 Always up for interesting data projects, especially if they involve data analysis or ML/AI!
